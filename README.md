AI-Driven Framework for Identifying Translational Potential of Epilepsy-Related Genes from Human to Mouse Models

Project Title: AI Model for Translational Epilepsy Research
Description: This project aims to bridge the gap between mouse models and human epilepsy treatment by identifying epilepsy-related genes with high translational potential. Using an AI framework, we analyze gene expression in human and mouse models and correlate it with electrophysiological data to better understand therapeutic targets for epilepsy.

Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

Identify Human Epilepsy-Associated Genes: Use exome sequencing data to pinpoint ultra-rare genetic variants associated with epilepsy.
Map Human Genes to Mouse Orthologs: Find mouse orthologs of these human genes to analyze expression patterns and interactions.
Differential Expression Analysis: Examine expression differences in mouse temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) models, identifying genes that show similar patterns in both humans and mice.
Develop a Predictive AI Model: Create a model that predicts which genes have high translational potential, improving the selection of therapeutic targets.
Correlate with Electrophysiological Data: Link gene functions to electrophysiological markers like neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission.

The project aims to utilizes multiple datasets for a comprehensive analysis:

Exome Sequencing Data: Data from 20,979 individuals with epilepsy, used to identify human epilepsy-associated genes.
Transcriptomic Data: Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data from mouse hippocampal TLE models to analyze gene expression changes.
Electrophysiological Data: Long-term local field potential (LFP) recordings from rats with chronic seizures, linking genetic findings to brain activity.

To add this BioHackathon project to GitHub, here’s a step-by-step guide, including a short description and recommended structure:

Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository
Go to your GitHub profile and click on the “New” button next to Repositories.

Name the repository something descriptive, like Epilepsy_Gene_Modeling or AI_Epilepsy_BioHack.

Add a short description (you can copy-paste this one):

"AI-Driven Framework for Identifying Translational Potential of Epilepsy-Related Genes from Human to Mouse Models"

Set visibility to Public or Private, depending on your needs.

Check the box to Initialize with a README.

Step 2: Add Project Information
README.md
Overview: Include the project title and a short paragraph explaining the purpose:

Project Title: AI Model for Translational Epilepsy Research
Description: This project aims to bridge the gap between mouse models and human epilepsy treatment by identifying epilepsy-related genes with high translational potential. Using an AI framework, we analyze gene expression in human and mouse models and correlate it with electrophysiological data to better understand therapeutic targets for epilepsy.

Objectives: Summarize objectives, such as identifying relevant genes, mapping human genes to mouse orthologs, and linking genes to electrophysiological data.

Datasets: Mention the datasets, like exome sequencing of epilepsy patients, mouse model transcriptomics data, and rat LFP recordings​(BioHack).

Research Impact: Outline how the project could improve epilepsy treatment success by enhancing gene target selection.

Step 3: Create a Folder Structure
Use a clear structure to organize files:

bash
Copy code
- data/                      # Store data files or links
- notebooks/                 # Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model training
- scripts/                   # Python scripts for preprocessing and analysis
- results/                   # Results such as model outputs, charts
- docs/                      # Documentation and references
- README.md                  # Project overview and details
- LICENSE                    # License file (choose a suitable one)
Step 4: Add Documentation
In the docs/ folder, you can create markdown files like:

Data Sources.md: Describe each dataset and include any links.
Methodology.md: Detail the step-by-step approach, covering gene identification, ortholog mapping, differential expression analysis, AI model, and validation.
Step 5: Code and Notebooks
Exploratory Data Analysis: Include Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder that walk through EDA, such as analyzing human and mouse gene expressions.
Preprocessing: Add scripts for mapping genes and processing data.
Modeling: Use scripts or notebooks to demonstrate training and validating the AI model with clear explanations.
Step 6: Results and Visualizations
In the results/ folder, add any visualizations, tables, or insights gained from the analysis.

Step 7: Commit and Push
After setting up, commit and push changes to GitHub. You can add details for future work in the README if the project evolves.
